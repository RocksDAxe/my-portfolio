    <li> <h2>Little about myself:</h2>
     <h3>I'M A FAST LEARNER!</h3>
     <p>I'm a simple guy who started coding after getting into the uni with no previous experience. That taught me even if I'm starting from the scratch in a particular field, I can still sharpen my skills and master that field in no time.
     </p>

     <h3>I SET HIGH GOALS!</h3>
     <p>I have a knack for setting High Goals, which naturally makes me a HARDWORKER to achieve that goal, no matter what. I've been told that I'm persistent. Setting goals are easy and simple, but achieving them and reaching them is something else. I will not stop until I reach my end goal!
